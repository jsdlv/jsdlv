## About My Journey In WEB Development

My path as a programmer began with the BASIC programming language in the distant nineties, already after the first attempts I realized that this would be my main desire - to become a programmer. The twists and turns of life have been such that it was not always possible to do programming, but this desire has never disappeared. <br><br>
Around 2018, this desire flared up with a new, much bigger flame, I started learning the basics of HTML, followed by CSS with an insight into SASS, the next step was already the first attempts in the JavaScript world, I started writing simple projects. 2019 was the first serious attempt, when I completed the "Komplekss Citadele" Development of web solutions course. And then came Covid-19... <br><br>
In 2022, I decided to start my studies at Alberta College, where I learned the basics of C++ during the first year and gained great experience in object-oriented programming. <br><br>
In 2023, I decided to take my knowledge to the next level and started working at Codelex, where I improved my PHP knowledge to unprecedented heights under the guidance of my excellent mentor JƒÅnis. I created various projects in the PHP language using Laravel, gained good experience in working with various APIs, improved my experience in working with databases using MySQL. <br>
